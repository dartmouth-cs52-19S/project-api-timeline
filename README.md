# Timeline

![Team Photo](src/img/teamTimeline.jpeg)

Timeline is amorphous, unique, and mysterious. Super cool. You don't really know what it is. We don't either! Let's hope we both find out in the next two weeks.

## Architecture

Code is based off Abhi's Lab 5 for backend (this) and Regina's Lab 4/5 for frontend. 

## Setup
`yarn` all the things

## Deployment
heroku git: https://git.heroku.com/timimeline.git
heroku domain: https://timimeline.herokuapp.com/

Stay tuned for the deployed site. Change the deploy URL in package.json to another surge URL and hit that `yarn deploy`.

To test locally, clone `project-api-timeline` and `project-timeline` repos. `yarn dev` it all, and mongod/mongo the backend. Frontend runs on localhost port 8080 while backend runs on 9090.
